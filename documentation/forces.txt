In fantastic physics, there are 2 fundamental forces: muon force and touch force.

1) Muon force:
    Muon force is the force caused by the muon properties of bosons.

        F_M = - k_MW / d^3

    k_M here is the muon constant, W is muon number and d is distance (in pixels).

2) Touch force:
    Touch force is the force that helps keep the bosons away from each other.

        F_T = k_T / d^4

    k_T here is the touch constant and d is distance (in pixels).

4) Net force:
    Net force is how much the bosons will repel. If the value is negative, bosons attract.
    Net force can be calculated by summing muon and touch forces.

        F_net = F_M + F_T = k_T / d^4 - k_MW / d^3 (d is pixels)

    Which can be simplified as:

        F_net = k_M(r_n - Wd) / d^4 (d is pixels)

    4.1) Resting distance:
        The balance distance of two bosons is called resting distance, which can be found using Fnet = 0.
        For perfect molecules can be calculated easily.
        For others, analysis is required.
        R must be found to calculate standard enthalpy.

            d = R = k_T / k_M / W (pixel)

    4.2) r_n constant:
        The r_n constant is defined as the distance of a and a' bosons that does not attract or repel.
        To calculate r_n, d = d = k_T / k_M / W can be used.

            r_n = k_T / k_M (pixel)

    4.3) Ru unit:
        1 ru distance is the same as r_n pixels distance.

            R = 1 / W (ru)

        Fnet can be recalculated for the ru unit using d = xr_n.
        When that is calculated and simplified, this is the result:

            F_net = k_M(1 - Wx) / (x^4r_n^3) (x is ru)
