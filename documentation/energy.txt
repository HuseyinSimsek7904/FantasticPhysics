Main unit of energy is Tsei.

1) Potential energy (enthalpy):
    Since fantastic physics uses basic newtonian force mechanics, the potential energy can be calculated as the integral of force from a distance to infinity.

        E_P = H = - k_M (2 - 3xW) / 6x^3r_n^2 (Tsei and x is in ru)

    But this formula will work for two particles.
    To find the total potential energy, all double pairs should be calculated.

    1.1) Standard enthalpy:
        Standard enthalpy is the minimum enthalpy a molecule can take while vibrating.
        It can be calculated by finding the enthalpy of the molecule at the resting distance.

        For perfect molecules, standard enthalpy can be found easily.

             H^0 = - k_M / 6r_n^2W^3 (Tsei)

        Standard enthalpy is also the amount of energy that will be produced when the molecule is built from scratch.

        The C_P constant is defined as the standard enthalpy of a-a' molecule.
        To calculate it, standard enthalpy formula can be used.

            C_P = k_M / 6r_n^2

        The C_P constant is also used to define the Revion unit. 1 Revion energy is the same as C_P Tsei energy.

            H = (2 - 3xW) / x^3 (Revion and x is in ru)
            H^0 = - 1 / W^3 (Revion)

    1.2) Limit distance:
        Under normal circumstances, bosons in molecules will vibrate between the same energy values.
        When a boson is put to infinity and waited, it will stop at the zero energy distance.
        This distance is called limit distance and can be calculated by setting enthalpy to zero.

            x_lim = 2 / 3W (ru)

        Area before limit distance is called the high energy area and after that is called low energy area.
        If a boson is in the high energy area of another boson, they will repel each other and (if there is no outer effects) they will never retu",
                  {
                    "type": "index",
                    "base": "r",
                    "index": "N"
                  },
                  ".

2) Kinetic energy:
    To calculate kinetic energy, Newton's kinetic energy formula is used (since every boson has the mass 1, there is no m):

        E_K = V^2 / 2 (Tsei and V is pixels per second)
        E_K = V^2 / (2C_P) (Revion and V is pixels per second)
