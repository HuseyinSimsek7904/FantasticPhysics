1) Bosons:
    Bosons in fantastic physics are the main particles.
    They have a position and a velocity in the space.
    The change of velocity is defined as the force.
    Every boson contains properties called muons.

2) Muons:
    Muons can take the values -1, 0 or 1. Those are used to calculate the muon force.
    The muon force changes with distance and muon number.
    That muon number determines whether particles attract or repel each other and how strong is that force.
    When muon number is positive, particles attract each other, and when negative they repel.
    Muon number is calculated for each muon property separately and then summed.

    There are 2 types of muons: normal and reversed.

    2.1) Normal muons:
        Those muons are called a, b, c and d.
        When calculating the muon number of normal muons, the properties of bosons are multiplied and negated.
        Since it is negated, two same muons repel.

    2.2) Reversed muons:
        Those muons are called x, y and z.
        When calculating the muon number of normal muons, the properties of bosons are only multiplied.
        Since it is not negated, two same muons attract.

3) Molecules:
    Molecules are stable groups of bosons.
    For a molecule with n bosons to be possible, it must contain at least n-1 bonds. But that does not guarantee it to be possible.

    3.1) Perfect molecules:
        All bosons of perfect molecules have 0 net force with each other.
        Which means distances can directly be calculated as 1/W.

        R = 1 / W
        H^0 = - W_1^3 - W_2^3 - ...
